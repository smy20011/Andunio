#Andruino: Operate and program Arduino via your android phone

# Motivation

Arduino have very limited memory and rom size (2k~4k bytes) and Its CPU is not power enough.
The hardware of Arduino limits our ability to use Arduino do complex processing. Our smartphones,
in other side, have very powerful CPUs and large memory(2-3 Giga bytes) and a lot of external sensors.
Thus we can use your unused android phone to control our Arduino. We can utilize the speed of your smartphones
and the input/output interface of Arduino.
